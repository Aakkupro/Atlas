# Atlas: Your World Exploration Companion

Atlas is a web application that empowers you to explore the world around you seamlessly. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Atlas combines the power of Mapbox and Foursquare APIs to provide location search, directions, weather information, and discovery of nearby points of interest.

## Features

### HTML

-   **Structured Content:** The application leverages semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>` etc.) for well-organized and accessible content.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Input fields, dropdown menus, and buttons enable user interaction for searching locations and categories.

### CSS

-   **Visually Appealing Design:** Custom CSS styles create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
-   **Responsive Layout:** The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### JavaScript

-   **Mapbox Integration:** Mapbox GL JS library enables interactive map rendering, navigation controls, geocoding (location search), and directions.
-   **Foursquare API Integration:** Foursquare Places API enables the discovery and display of nearby places based on user-selected categories.
-   **OpenWeatherMap API Integration:** Fetches and displays current weather information for the selected destination.
-   **Dynamic Content Loading:** JavaScript dynamically updates map content, search results, weather information, and nearby places based on user interactions.
-   **Geolocation:** Uses the browser's geolocation API to determine the user's current location (with permission), enhancing user experience.

## Functionality

1.  **Location Search:** Users can search for a specific location using the search bar. The Mapbox Geocoding API is used to convert location names into geographical coordinates, which are then displayed on the map.
2.  **Category Filtering:** A dropdown menu allows users to select from various categories (e.g., restaurants, parks, museums) to discover nearby points of interest. The Foursquare Places API fetches and displays relevant places based on the selected category.
3.  **Directions:** Users can get directions to their desired location. The Mapbox Directions API is used to calculate and display the route on the map.
4.  **Weather Information:** Atlas provides real-time weather information for the destination. The OpenWeatherMap API fetches and displays weather data, including temperature, conditions, and an icon representing the weather.
5.  **Nearby Places:** The app dynamically displays a list of nearby places based on the user's selected location and category. Users can click on a place to view its address and distance, further enhancing the exploratory experience.

## Enhancements

1.  **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts to enable users to save their favorite locations, create custom routes, and share their discoveries with others.
2.  **Augmented Reality:** Integrate AR capabilities to provide users with an immersive experience of their surroundings, overlaying information about nearby places directly onto their camera view.
3.  **Offline Mode:** Allow users to download maps and place information for offline use, enhancing the app's functionality in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.
4.  **Accessibility Features:** Improve accessibility by implementing features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for images, making the app usable for individuals with disabilities.
5.  **Customizable Markers:**  Allow users to personalize their map experience by adding custom markers or annotations to signify places of interest.
